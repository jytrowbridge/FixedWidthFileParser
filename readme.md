# Fixed Width File Parser

Simple program and GUI to parse fixed-width files.

### Installing

Simply run the batch file. By default, creates shortcut on desktop and start menu. The start menu shortcut will not appear until after a restart.

### Using

Enter valid path to a fixed-width file, valid path to where the parsed file should be written, and a comma-separated list of widths, and run.

If the widths don't match the actual length of the lines, a warning will be thrown but the file will be parsed as able.
