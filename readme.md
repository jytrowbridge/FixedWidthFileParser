# Fixed Width File Parser

Simple program and GUI to parse fixed-width files.

### Requirements

Python 3 must be installed and added to the Path variable. The Python 3.7.1 installer is included. Make sure to check "Add to Path".

### Installing

If necessary, run the Python installer, making sure to check "Add to Path".

To install, simply run "install.bat". By default, this creates shortcut on desktop and start menu. The start menu shortcut will not appear until after a restart.

### Using

If install failed, the parser can be run via the "run_parsre.bat" file.

Enter valid path to a fixed-width file, valid path to where the parsed file should be written, and a comma-separated list of widths, and run.

If the widths don't match the actual length of the lines, a warning will be thrown but the file will be parsed as able.
