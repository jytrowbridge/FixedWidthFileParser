HOW BEST TO DO THIS?
    - could make them all distinct attributes (edit in box, edit log box, etc)
        - I think this is the safest option
        - I could still write a function to return frames that are shared?
        - plus I need to be able to grab fill out te box dynamically
    - could write a function that takes a parent and creates the shared objects
        - but would need to be local variables
    - I could also maybe make a generic file manipulation class
        - in, widths, log box, out (optional)
        - then I could grid the things later and add custom things...
        - might need to store these in an array to be able to log to all levels

    - definitely not doing this the best way oh well though

- would be cool if you can save elemnts so you don't have to copy the widths every time

- should just call the encase parser in the another function
    this is getting very convoluted

- if I can't add stuff to the grid after it's been gridded there's not much point of doing this
    - seems to work
    - can't tell if i'm doing it wrong or if adding frames is fucked up
    - yay it works
    - for some reason the grid has to be on a separate line from the declaration
- l
